Absolutely — beyond just *polling units*, there **are several related datasets and resources from INEC you can pull and structure into a JSON format** for deeper integration into your system or analytics workflows.

Here’s a breakdown of what *official INEC data exists*, *what’s commonly available in open/community sources*, and *how you can integrate them into your database*.

---

## 📦 Key INEC Data Types You Can Collect

### 1. **Polling Unit Master List**

This is the core list (which we already started with) — includes:

* State
* LGA
* Ward
* Polling Unit name/code
* (Sometimes) geo coordinates
  This was available via community repo and can be transformed into JSON. ([GitHub][1])

---

### 2. **States, LGAs, Wards & PU Hierarchy**

There’s a community JSON repo that already structures:

* State
* Local Governments
* Wards
* Polling Units inside them
  All in nested JSON. ([GitHub][2])

You can **merge this with geolocation and INEC codes** from the polling-units CSV you already pulled.

---

### 3. **Polling Units with No Registered Voters**

INEC has official PDFs listing specific polling units with no registered voters — useful for data cleaning and deduplication. ([INEC Nigeria][3])
You can parse this PDF and merge into your JSON dataset with a flag like:

```json
{
  "polling_unit_id": "...",
  "no_registered_voters": true
}
```

---

### 4. **Voter Register Totals / PVC Statistics**

INEC publishes PVC (Permanent Voter Card) collection statistics by state and polling unit in some election cycles. ([INEC Nigeria][4])

This *is not direct polling unit detail*, but can be attached per PU where available to show:

* Total PVC collected
* Registered voters
  This becomes another field in your JSON schema.

---

### 5. **Election Results (Nationwide or by Unit)**

INEC maintains a results portal (called IREV) that shows results by polling unit — *if available and uploaded for that election cycle*. ([INEC Election Results][5])

For example, results for the **2023 general elections** include:

* Total votes per polling unit
* Votes per party/candidate

*This data can be scraped or API-ingested and appended to your PU JSON.*

---

## 📊 Suggested JSON Schema for Complete INEC Data

Here’s an enhanced structure combining all the above:

```json
{
  "polling_unit_id": "24-03-11-013",
  "state": "Lagos",
  "lga": "Kosofe",
  "ward": "Abule Egba/Meiran",
  "name": "In front of 39 Ekoro road",
  "latitude": 6.5289,
  "longitude": 3.3757,
  "registered_voters": 340,
  "pvc_collected": 230,
  "no_registered_voters": false,
  "election_results": [
    {
      "election_type": "President_2023",
      "party": "APC",
      "votes": 150
    },
    {
      "election_type": "President_2023",
      "party": "PDP",
      "votes": 120
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🛠 How to Acquire Each Dataset

### 📌 Polling Unit + Geo & Codes

Already covered via the GitHub CSV → JSON transformation. ([GitHub][1])

---

### 📌 States + LGAs + Wards Hierarchy

You can pull the community JSON and merge with your master PU list:

```
fetch(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afeibukun/nigerian-state-lgas-wards-polling-units/main/states-and-lgas-and-wards-and-polling-units.json"
)
```

Then normalize and join on common fields.

---

### 📌 Data from INEC PDFs

For PDFs like **PUs with no registered voters** or **mock allocations**:

* Use a PDF parser (like Python’s *tabula* or *camelot*)
* Output raw data per PU
* Merge back with your main JSON by matching PU codes

Example script workflow:

```python
import camelot
tables = camelot.read_pdf("PUs-with-no-Registered-Voter-2.pdf")
for table in tables:
    df = table.df
    # normalize and add to master JSON
```

---

### 📌 Election Results API / Scraper

INEC’s *IREV* site technically displays result data per PU, but:

* It doesn’t publish an official API endpoint
* You may need to scrape (or build API wrappers) to pull results

E.g., if you have a list of PU IDs, you can query the result page for that unit and extract votes.

---

## 🛠 Final Integration Steps

Here’s a recommended ETL roadmap:

1. **Extract**

   * Download polling-units CSV
   * Clone state/LGA/ward JSON
   * Parse INEC PDF lists
   * Pull results from IREV

2. **Transform**

   * Normalize all codes (state/LGA/ward)
   * Add geo data
   * Merge election results

3. **Load**

   * Save as `json` file with full schema
   * Insert into DB (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)

4. **Indexing**

   * Index on `polling_unit_id`, `ward`, `lga`, etc.

## 📊 Want Me to Generate Something Ready?

I can build you:

✅ A **clean JSON dataset** that includes states, LGAs, wards, and polling unit details
✅ A merged version with election results (if you specify which election year/type)
✅ A **DB schema + ETL scripts** to keep it updated over time

Just tell me:

* **Which election data** you want included (e.g., 2023 Presidential / Governorship / Both)?
* **Which database** you’re targeting (SQL / NoSQL)?

And I’ll generate a tailored package for you.
