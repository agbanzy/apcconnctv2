APC Connect — Where We Stand
Your platform is a substantial, feature-rich codebase covering 22+ modules across three layers: Express server (11,400+ line monolithic routes file), React web client (44 pages), and Expo mobile app (29 screens). The architecture is solid — Drizzle ORM, React Query, Passport.js + JWT dual auth — but there are issues to address before production.
Overall Scores:

Server/API: 6.5/10 — good foundations, critical security gaps
Web Client: 7.0/10 — feature-complete, needs performance + accessibility work
Mobile App: 6.7/10 — strong skeleton, incomplete payments/push/offline
Mobile Responsiveness (web): 7.5/10 — good Tailwind patterns, tablet gaps

8 Critical Issues (must fix before launch):

Hardcoded session secret fallback in routes.ts
Socket.IO CORS set to * (any origin)
No input validation on PATCH endpoints (mass assignment risk)
JWT secret falls back to random generation per restart
Android keystore passwords committed to repo (credentials.json)
API URL hardcoded to localhost in mobile app.json
Digital ID token exposed in URL parameter
No SSL certificate pinning on mobile

Biggest wins for effort:

Week 1: Fix the 8 critical security issues
Week 2: Add error boundaries + code splitting to web, wire Paystack into mobile
Week 3-4: Push notifications, offline support, split routes.ts into modules

Mobile app gaps vs web: Payments not wired, push notifications not activated, no offline support, no dark mode, no biometric auth. Estimated 4-6 weeks to full parity.
